    <p> <b>Lorem Impsum </b>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
     has been the <br/> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a 
     galley of type and  <span style="color: red"> <B> scrambled</B>  </span> it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.  </p>
